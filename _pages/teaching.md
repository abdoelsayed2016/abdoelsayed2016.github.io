## Assiut University, Egypt  
*Research and Teaching Assistant, Faculty of Computers and Information (2015–2019)*

At Assiut University I taught labs, tutorials, and occasionally lectures for several undergraduate courses in Computer Science, including:

- **Web Programming** – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic PHP/Laravel.  
- **Introduction to Programming (C++)** – programming fundamentals, problem solving, and object-oriented concepts.  
- **Data Structures** – arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks/queues, and complexity analysis.  
- **Machine Learning** – classical ML algorithms and applications.  
- **Project Management** – software project planning, teamwork, and reporting.  
- **Network Management** – basic computer networking and administration concepts.

My responsibilities included preparing and grading assignments and exams, running lab sessions, mentoring student projects, and updating course materials.
