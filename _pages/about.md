**Pronouns:** He/Him

Hello. I’m **Abdelrahman Abdallah**, a final-year Ph.D. candidate advised by
[Professor Adam Jatowt](https://ds-informatik.uibk.ac.at/doku.php?id=homepage)
at the [Digital Science Center (DiSC)](https://www.uibk.ac.at/disc/),
[Department of Computer Science](https://www.uibk.ac.at/informatik/index.html.en),
[University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/index.html.en).
Currently, I am a research assistant at DiSC. Previously, I worked as a
machine learning engineer at [DISCO App](https://discoapp.ai/) in Cairo and at
[KMG Engineering](https://www.kmge.kz/en/home_en/) in Kazakhstan, as a machine learning researcher at [Satbayev
University](https://satbayev.university/en) and [Università Ca’ Foscari Venezia](https://www.unive.it/), and as a research and teaching
assistant at [Assiut University](https://www.aun.edu.eg/main/) in Egypt.

As a researcher in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP),
my work focuses on **large language models (LLMs)**, **information retrieval**,
and **question answering**. I am particularly interested in how LLMs can be
used for document retrieval and reranking, robust QA on noisy or OCR text, and
reasoning over temporal information in dynamic collections.

<!-- In pursuit of more reliable and inclusive NLP systems, I have worked on

(1) developing datasets and methods for multilingual,
(2) designing LLM-based rerankers and evaluation frameworks for retrieval, and
(3) building OCR and document-understanding pipelines for real-world
applications such as receipts and forms. -->

My research interests include:

- LLM-based Reranking & Information Retrieval
- Open-domain & Multilingual Question Answering
- Temporal Reasoning for QA & Retrieval
- Bias in Large Language Models
